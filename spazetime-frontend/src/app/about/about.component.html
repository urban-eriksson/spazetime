        <h1>Spazetime, the new paradigm for global time keeping</h1>

        <p>Even Einstein understood that you cannot just separate space and time. At one place in the world it can be
            early afternoon,
            while at another, it is in the middle of the night. So who decides what time it is at the place you are
            standing or sitting
            in right now? Should it be some random dude drawing time zones on a map? No, of course not. It should be our
            sun, as has been
            the case since the dawn of life on this planet, up until only very recently. Time of day should be in
            harmony with noon and
            midnight for everyone, at every location. This is how time was originally defined and meant to be. Now there
            would seem to
            arise a problem with this. How will people at different places agree on which time things should be done?
            Enter spazetime.</p>

        <h2>How does spazetime work?</h2>

        <p>Spazetime consists of two components, spaze and time. Time is simply the local solar time. The day starts
            when the night is at its darkest, 00:00 and ends 24 hours later. 12:00 then naturally conicides with noon.
            Spaze is your east-west position on earth. It is essentially the same as the longitudinal position. To
            simplify calculations, it has the same units as time: hours, minutes and seconds and a reversed sign. One
            lap around the world equals 24 hours of spaze. In other words you can simply calculate spaze by taking the
            minus of the longitude divided by 15. Both spaze and time can nowadays easily be obtained with a mobile
            phone, by using the GPS and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To get the local solar time, spaze is
            simply subtracted from the UTC.</p>

        <p>When communicating with other people, one should always use both spaze and time. Nothing more then needs to
            be specified. No time zones need to be considered, they are completely obsolete. No more summer time or
            winter time. No more misunderstandings when setting up phone meetings accross continents.</p>

        <h3><u>Example 1:</u></h3>

        <p>(1) The Mumbai office sets up a meeting at [[Spaze: -5:00, Time: 14:00]]</p>

        <p>(2) You are located at [[Spaze: 1:00]]</p>

        <p>What will be the local meeting time for you?</p>

        <p>Solution:</p>

        <p>Transform point (1) to the spaze where you are located. The rule when doing tranformations in spaze
            is to the keep the sum of the two spazetime components constant.
            In this case that sum is equal to 9:00. Point (1) then becomes:</p>

        <p>(1') [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 8:00]]</p>

        <p>Answer:</p>

        <p>The meeting time will be at local time 8:00 given your location.</p>

        <h3><u>Example 2:</u></h3>

        <p>(1) You are at [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 10:30]]</p>

        <p>(2) The bus leaves at [[Spaze: 1:30, Time: 12:00]]</p>

        <p>How long is it until the bus leaves?</p>

        <p>Solution:</p>

        <p>A time difference can easily be calculated for two spazetime points at the same spaze. It is then simply the
            difference between the two time components. So first transform point (2) to (1) in spaze. The rule is, once
            again, to keep the sum of the two components constant, so decreasing one should be followed by increasing
            the other. Transforming point (2) to the same point in spaze as point (1) gives:</p>

        <p>(2') [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 12:30]]</p>

        <p>Time duration = (2').Time - (1).Time = 2:00 hours</p>

        <p>Answer:</p>

        <p>It is two hours until the bus leaves.</p>
