        <h1>Spazetime, the new paradigm for global time keeping</h1>

        <p>Even Einstein understood that you cannot just separate space and time. At one place in the world it can be
            early afternoon, while at another, it is in the middle of the night. So who decides what time it is at the
            place you are standing or sitting in right now? Should it be some random dude drawing time zones on a map?
            No, of course not. It should be our sun, as has been the case since the dawn of life on this planet, up
            until just very recently. Time of day should be in harmony with noon and midnight for everyone, at every
            location. This is how time was originally defined and meant to be. Now there would seem to arise a problem
            with this. How will people at different places agree on which time things should be done? Enter spazetime.

        <h2>How does spazetime work?</h2>

        <p>Spazetime consists of two components, spaze and time. Time is simply the local solar time. The day starts
            when the night is at its darkest, 00:00 and ends 24 hours later. 12:00 then naturally conicides with noon.
            Spaze is the east-west position on earth, and is directly related to your longitudinal position. It has been
            given the same units as time: hours, minutes and seconds. One lap around the world then equals 24 hours of
            spaze. One can simply calculate spaze by dividing the longitude with 15 and reversing the sign. Spaze can
            nowadays easily be obtained with a mobile phone, by using the GPS. The local solar time is a litte bit more
            complicated. First the mean solar time can be calculated by subtracting spaze from the Coordinated Universal
            Time (UTC). To get closer to the true local solar time one needs to apply a correction because of the
            obliquity of the eccliptic for the earth and also the eccentricity of the earth's orbit around the sun.
            These effects are summarized into something which is called the "equation of time", see figure 1. There
            exist different levels of refinement for this calculation, and to get the true local solar time to within a
            roughly a second of accuracy the calculations get quite complicated. One can use simpler formulas, but still
            be able to predict the local solar time with an accuracy in the order of +/- 10 seconds, see for example:

        <p>The formula in the referenced document is what has been used in this application. In order to make spazetime
            a global standard, one single formula needs to be agreed on.</p>

        <p>To conclude, when communicating with other people, one should always use both spaze and time. Nothing more
            then needs to be specified. No time zones need to be considered, they are completely obsolete. No more
            summer time or winter time. No more misunderstandings when setting up phone meetings accross continents.</p>

        <h3><u>Example 1:</u></h3>

        <p>(1) The Mumbai office sets up a meeting at [[Spaze: -5:00, Time: 14:00]]</p>

        <p>(2) You are located at [[Spaze: 1:00]]</p>

        <p>What will be the local meeting time for you?</p>

        <p>Solution:</p>

        <p>Transform point (1) to the spaze where you are located. The rule when doing tranformations in spaze
            is to the keep the sum of the two spazetime components constant.
            In this case that sum is equal to 9:00. Point (1) then becomes:</p>

        <p>(1') [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 8:00]]</p>

        <p>Answer:</p>

        <p>The meeting time will be at local time 8:00 given your location.</p>

        <h3><u>Example 2:</u></h3>

        <p>(1) You are at [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 10:30]]</p>

        <p>(2) The bus leaves at [[Spaze: 1:30, Time: 12:00]]</p>

        <p>How long is it until the bus leaves?</p>

        <p>Solution:</p>

        <p>A time difference can easily be calculated for two spazetime points at the same spaze. It is then simply the
            difference between the two time components. So first transform point (2) to (1) in spaze. The rule is, once
            again, to keep the sum of the two components constant, so decreasing one should be followed by increasing
            the other. Transforming point (2) to the same point in spaze as point (1) gives:</p>

        <p>(2') [[Spaze: 1:00, Time: 12:30]]</p>

        <p>Time duration = (2').Time - (1).Time = 2:00 hours</p>

        <p>Answer:</p>

        <p>It is two hours until the bus leaves.</p>
